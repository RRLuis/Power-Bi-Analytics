# Global Superstore Sales Analysis

This repository contains a Power BI project analyzing the **Global Superstore Dataset**, with a focus on sales, profit, and customer segmentation. The primary goal of this project is to enhance **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) skills** while extracting valuable insights from the data.

## Project Overview

This project was created for **learning purposes**, aiming to practice and improve DAX proficiency. It consists of **20 DAX measures**, ranging from basic to intermediate levels, that help derive key business insights, including:

- **Sales and profit tracking**
- **Customer segmentation and ranking**
- **Shipping performance analysis**
- **Year-over-year growth and forecasting**
- **Dynamic filtering and contribution analysis**

## DAX Measures Included

### Basic to Intermediate Measures

- **Total Sales** – Sum of all sales revenue.
- **Total Profit** – Sum of total profit.
- **Profit Margin (%)** – Calculates profit as a percentage of sales.
- **Total Orders** – Distinct count of order IDs.
- **Average Order Price** – Sales divided by the number of orders.
- **Sales per Customer** – Total sales grouped by customer.
- **Delayed Shipments Count** – Number of delayed orders.
- **Year-over-Year Sales Growth** – Sales difference compared to the previous year.
- **Year-over-Year Growth (%)** – Percentage increase or decrease in sales.
- **Country Sales Ranking** – Ranks countries based on sales volume.
- **Cumulative Sales by Year** – Running total of sales within a year.
- **Top 5 Selling Categories** – Sales of the top 5 product categories.
- **Previous Month Sales** – Sales from the prior month.
- **Month-over-Month Sales Difference** – Change in sales from the previous month.
- **High Stock Product Sales** – Sales for products with inventory above a certain threshold.

### Upper-Intermediate Measures

- **Sales Contribution by Region (%)** – Percentage of sales contributed by each region.
- **Next Month Sales Projection** – Forecasted sales based on a 3-month moving average.
- **Customer Profitability Classification** – Labels customers as “Profitable” or “Not Profitable.”
- **Top-Selling Category Sales** – Dynamically retrieves the highest-selling category’s sales.
- **Customer Purchase Segmentation** – Categorizes customers into low, medium, or high-value buyers.

## How to Use

1. **Import the dataset** into Power BI.
2. **Add the provided DAX measures** to the data model.
3. **Create visualizations and reports** based on these measures.
4. **Extend the project** by adding new KPIs or dashboards when time permits.

## Future Enhancements

- **Build interactive dashboards** to visualize sales trends, regional performance, and customer behavior.
